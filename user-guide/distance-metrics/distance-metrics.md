# Distance Metrics

To evaluate the precision of a symbolic regression algorithm, or the loss in training of such algorithm, we need a distance metric between equations. Evaluating such a distance is not straight forward. The Equation Tree pacakge therefore includes various metrics that can be used individually or in conjunction:

- [**Prediction Distance.**](#prediction-distance) Distance between function values as proposed by La Cava et al. (2021).
- [**Symbolic Solution.**](#symbolic-solution) Another metric proposed by La Cava et al. (2021) is called symbolic solution, designed to capture SR models that differ from the true model by a constant or scalar.
- [**Normalized Edit Distance.**](#normalized-edit-distance) Matsubara et al. (2022) propose a normalized edit distance for the trees. For a pair of two trees, edit distance computes the minimum cost to transform one to another with a sequence of operations, each of which either 1) inserts, 2) deletes, or 3) renames a node.
