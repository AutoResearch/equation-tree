# Equation Tree

The Equation Tree package is an equation toolbox with symbolic regression in mind. It represents
expressions as incomplete binary trees and has various features tailored towards testing symbolic
regression algorithms or training models. The main features are:

- Equation sampling (including priors)
- Feature Extraction from equation distributions
- Distance metrics between equations
