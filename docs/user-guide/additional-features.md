## Analysing Equation Distributions

Given an equation, our package can extract features like number of constants, and variables, and various equation complexity measurements (For example, number of nodes and tree depth.)

For a list of equations, our package is capable to  access frequencies for operators, functions, features, and structures. These frequencies can in turn be used to sample new equations that mimic the original list in these aspects.

A possible application of this feature can involve scraping equations from equations. Another package developed by the AutoRA group can be used to obtain a list of equations: [https://autoresearch.github.io/equation-scraper/tutorials/equation_scraper_tutorial/](https://autoresearch.github.io/equation-scraper/tutorials/equation_scraper_tutorial/)
