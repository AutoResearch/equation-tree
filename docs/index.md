# Equation Tree

The Equation Tree package is an equation toolbox with symbolic regression in mind. It represents expressions as an incomplete binary [equation tree](user-guide/equation-formats.md) and has various features tailored towards testing symbolic regression algorithms or training models. The most notable features are:

- [**Equation Sampling**](user-guide/equation-sampling.md)
- Calculating [Distance Metrics](user-guide/distance-metrics.md) between equations

It also encompasses a variety of [additional features](user-guide/additional-features.md). For example, to obtain information about existing equation list that can, in turn, be used in our sampling method.
